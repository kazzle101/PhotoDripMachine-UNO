# Photo Drip Machine-UNO
Code for my Water Drip Machine for taking photos of water droplets
This version just about fits on a Arduino Uno with the libaries for the OLED acreen and IR Remote control, although the PCF8574 library is mostly redundant.

The software is a bit scrappy, I'm working on a new version for the Teensy.
